# Rover-with-Raspberry-Pi
Rover is a robot. It can go forward, backward, left and right. It can be controlled remotely from a web-server, which makes the rover, platform independent and can be remotely accessed from anywhere, you just need an internet connection to access the rover. And it can also be controlled remotely from an android app. There is a pi-cam attached to the rover which can rotate vertically and horizontally to different angles. There is a screen on a web-server where you can view where the rover is going, so your presence near the rover doesn't  require. The active time of rover is around 10-20min's and its battery can be charged wirelessly. And the last thing about it is, it can also go to the autonomous mode, you just have to press the 'Autopilot' button on the web-server.
